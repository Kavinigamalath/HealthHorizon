1
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:02,305
In the daytime,

2
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:03,413
I’m Gabriel.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,447
Just a normal man, with a normal life.

4
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:09,789
But I have a secret I must keep at any cost,

5
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,795
or all hope will be lost.

6
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:18,522
Miraculous! Fear is a cage. Hear the message, and serve the call.

7
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:24,405
Miraculous, yes you can change. The power of love will free us all.

8
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:28,453
Miraculous!

9
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:31,151
Hello and welcome!

10
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:34,074
If you're tuning in now, today's main event is, of course,

11
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:36,873
the new attack of Shadowmoth on Paris.

12
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,447
Luckily, Ladybug and Cat noir have saved Paris yet again.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,620
Clara, you're live--

14
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,652
- Is it ready? Can we make the jump?

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,322
- There's a 92.7% statistical chance of landing in the world 
where these source images originate.

16
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:55,944
I'm sorry. I can't stop them. They're coming.

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,991
We don't have a choice.

18
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,696
Fly my “Kamiko”,

19
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:07,407
and magnify the glimmer of hope that shines in Alya cesaire's heart.

20
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:08,371
Ubiquity!

21
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:09,828
I am “betterfly”.

22
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:14,170
I give you the power to connect to the parallel world we have located so we can find help.

23
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,908
With this gift, I am exposing you to many perils and placing a great burden on your shoulders.

24
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:20,784
Do you accept it for the greater good?

25
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:21,904
- I do.

26
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,785
After months of battle,

27
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:30,071
Super villain Monarch, who once went by Hawk Moth as well as Shadow Moth,

28
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:33,967
has managed to seize the miraculous that Ladybug had been guarding.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Monarch now threatens to attack Paris relentlessly.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We're heading straight for disaster. I knew it. I told you.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Shh. Be quiet, Mark. You're gonna jinx everything.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Fortunately, the people in Paris haven't lost hope and faithfully show their support for Lady--

33
00:02:56,386 --> 00:03:01,339
You've reached Natalie Sancour's voicemail. I am not available at the moment. Please leave a message.

34
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,897
This power is so heavy, Plagg. I feel like I'm losing control.

35
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:58,363
I feel the same every time I see a slice of chesse.

36
00:03:58,365 --> 00:03:59,666
It fades away eventually.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For real, Plagg. What if I ended up destroying everything around me without even meaning to?

38
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:06,662
For real?

39
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:13,924
Sometimes destroying is the best path to build a new. Trust me, it's worked for me more often than not.

40
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,736
- You really showed some self-control, Marinette.

41
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,991
- You-- you think?

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,915
- Of course. You didn't get the Kwamis back, but it's only a matter of time. I know it.

43
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:32,170
And here I was wondering how I could help you without superpowers, but you don't even need me.

44
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I need you. The one superpower you'll never lose is the power to be the best BFF ever.</font>

45
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I need you. The one superpower you'll never lose is the power to be the best BFF ever.</font>

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
After months of battle, supervillain Monarch, who once went by Hawkmoth as well as Shadowmoth,

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
has managed to seize the miraculous that Ladybug had been guarding.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Monarch now threatens to attack Paris relentlessly.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Did you hear that?

50
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:56,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear that?</font>

51
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:04,868
Now that Monarch has all the miraculous, I don't think I'll ever stop worrying.

52
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:10,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladybug's already got one back. Before you know it, everything will be back to normal.</font>

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The people of Paris haven't lost hope and faithfully show their support for Ladybug,

54
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,603
who must be quite affected by what's just happened to her.

55
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:21,938
Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug!

56
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,688
I'm not sure I can do it this time, Alya. :(

57
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:27,391
Monarch's got all the miraculous and cat noir and i…

58
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:30,647
It's just the two of us again. I feel like I've tried everything.

59
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,504
I just don't know what to do anymore.

60
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:33,571
Marinette,

61
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:36,442
it's normal for you to have your doubts, but you can't give up hope and--

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,124
Alya?

63
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,405
Alya!

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Forgive my intrusion, young lady. Please, don't be scared. My name is Betterfly.

65
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:03,221
I need someone to lead me to the holders of the miraculous of the Ladybug and the black cat in your world.

66
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:04,734
Ladybug and Cat Noir? but--

67
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,884
I don't know how to find them. I--

68
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,968
I don't know them. 
I'm just Marinette, just a normal girl.

69
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:13,257
I beg you. Please, they're my last hope.

70
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:16,269
I'm not sure there's anything to hope for from Ladybug.

71
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,829
Marinette, what just happened?

72
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,539
You transformed into--

73
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:26,642
Ubiquity.

74
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,340
In the universe where I come from, Alya cesaire is my ally.

75
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:32,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">She connected her power to you </font>
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to open a gateway between our two worlds.</font>

76
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:33,667
Uhhh?

77
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,993
UHH?! 
Is this another one of Monarch's schemes?

78
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,073
Monarch?

79
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,518
I'm sorry , they made me open again.

80
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:45,364
I can't hold them back for long.

81
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,900
RUUUUN !!!

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can't stay here. They're merciless.

83
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:51,021
No, hey! Let go of me!

84
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:06,817
There! You can have your boyfriend back!

85
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,184
Hey! Don't gank the tail!

86
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,682
At least now it's being put to good use.

87
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:18,928
Even in this world, we find pictures of that self-centered Adrien Agreste.

88
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,594
Well obviously, He can only be perfect here, too.

89
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,865
A perfect stuck-up rat. No wonder you're a fan of his.

90
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:30,964
They must have gone out this way.

91
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,939
I'd rather go out with a bang!

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And you are a ride back. Don't move.

93
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:57,989
Better fly. They tied me up.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,455
You carried out your mission perfectly. 

95
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,633
Thank you for everything.

96
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,841
I release you from the power I gave you.

97
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:09,257
Marinette? Marinette?

98
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,294
Everything okay, girls?

99
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:15,257
Uh, we're fine. Everything's fine, Ms. Dupain cheng.

100
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,583
We just, uh, we started playing a video game and the sound was too loud.

101
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:19,233
That's all!

102
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:22,931
Very well. Don't stay up too late, okay?

103
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,691
Sure thing. No worries.

104
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,571
Yes!

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,855
On which way did he go? He could be anywhere. 
The city is so big! We'll never find him.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Lucky charm!

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,743
What is it this time?

108
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,213
A butterfly tracker….. Kind of.

109
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,690
These binoculars can detect butterfly pheromones. 
Their smell, in a way.

110
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,781
Don't bother pretending to have a smart plan when all you have is luck.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And what's your plan besides showing off and destroying everything?

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ah, there it is.

113
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:37,992
Whatever happens, stay here where it's safe. No one should suffer because of a battle that isn't theirs.

114
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:40,505
Thank you for your help, little kamiko.

115
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,599
That's not an akuma.

116
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,608
An akuma?

117
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,979
Are you okay?

118
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:59,038
She'll use her lucky charm. I prefer intentional harm.

119
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,165
More direct. 
>:)

120
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:02,643
But not discreet and even less clever.

121
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:03,980
He can’t be that far.

122
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,283
- Bogger fly, we know you're hiding here.

123
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:10,527
- Show yourself, otherwise...
- We'll turn this lousy world to ash!

124
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:17,804
I'm sorry that you got involved in this fight. Please, take care of yourself.

125
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,272
Stop! The people of this world haven't harmed you.

126
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:24,624
- You know what to do then.
- Hand over the miraculous you stole.

127
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,433
TIKKI: Are you okay, Marinette?

128
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:32,643
Yes. No, I don't know, Tikki.

129
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,887
Marinette, did you get away from that super villain?

130
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:41,717
I think he's a holder of the miraculous of the butterfly, Alya, except a superhero, not a villain.

131
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:45,327
Look around you. A better world than ours is possible.

132
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,155
- The only thing I'm interested in looking at is your destruction.

133
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,210
- And your imminent defeat.

134
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,994
They have the same powers as Cat Noir and you?

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,453
They're the holders of the miraculous of the ladybug and the black cat from one of the billions of parallel universes in existence.

136
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,600
And those two are not very nice versions.

137
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:03,994
Parallel universes? Why don't you tell me about this?

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,988
It's just, I've lived for billions of years in every single one of these universes simultaneously.

139
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:13,523
And there simply aren't enough hours in your lifetime to tell you even the tiniest bit about it.

140
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:17,999
So, I choose to stick to the basics and make the most of the time we have together.

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The Supreme is manipulating you.

142
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's your fault. You shouldn't have stolen the miraculous from him.

143
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,467
The Supreme abuses his powers.

144
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,994
Power must be shared.

145
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,616
How can they use their powers repeatedly without transforming back?

146
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:40,602
Using the power of the miraculous draws vital energy from the Kwami, but also from the holder.

147
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:44,509
So there is a security system to protect those who are still a little too young.

148
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:48,676
Like you and Cat Noir, you transform back before it becomes dangerous for you.

149
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:53,608
- But for them… 
-They use their miraculous for evil purposes.

150
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,994
It overrides the security system.

151
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,952
- No more automatic de-transformation, but the price to pay for that is...
- Terrible?

152
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:08,278
Alya, don't let my parents go into my room before ladybug has fixed everything.

153
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,422
You can count on me.

154
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,993
Thanks. Tikki, spots on!

155
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:17,797
Trap like a bug, you ugly butterfly.

156
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,866
Join the resistance. Everything can change.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This world is the proof of it. It's not too late for you.

158
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:28,430
The resistance ends here, with you!

159
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,179
What in the--?

160
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,973
I never thought I'd ever say this, but...

161
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,844
Let go of the butterfly man!

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Another polka-dotted bug?

163
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:43,145
- The name's Ladybug. 
- Whatever pest.

164
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,382
Hand over your miraculous.

165
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:47,614
They shouldn't be used for evil, only for the greater good!

166
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,703
Ugh, how corny?

167
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:52,037
Ugh, I'm gonna barf up a hairball.

168
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:12,540
Lucky charm!

169
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:22,741
PUSH!

170
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:32,908
Cataclysm!

171
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,994
Easy, kitty. Trying to keep my cool.

172
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Think you're the cool cat?

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, is the itty-bitty kitty scared he might hurt me with his cute little paws?

174
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:47,179
Don't do it!

175
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:50,014
NO!

176
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:55,655
No black cat is as cool as this black cat!

177
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,827
Enough is enough!

178
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:06,979
The miraculous were not created to cause harm!

179
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,599
And what makes you so righteous, cockroach?

180
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,027
Are you with the super power police?

181
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,994
Lucky charm!

182
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:20,541
A traffic cone?

183
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:22,547
Oh no, I'm so scared!

184
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,675
Cataclysm!

185
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:30,940
Why do these akumatized heroes get all the magical powers and we don't? It's not fair.

186
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:31,946
They're not akumatized.

187
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,480
Then what are they?

188
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:34,993
They're Shadybug and Claw-noir.

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,378
And who the cat are you?

190
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,216
“Betterfly”. It's an honor.

191
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:40,987
- HUH?
- I know, I'll explain everything to you later.

192
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,529
They're gonna wish they were back in their world faster than a whip of my tail!

193
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,311
Watch out Cat Noir!

194
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:21,935
- Hey, what are you--?
- Celestia cat, I am Betterfly.

195
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:24,199
No, get out of my head!

196
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:27,987
I'm not your enemy. I only want to entrust you with the power to save us.

197
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,902
How do I know you're telling the truth? I don't know you.

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I only work for the greater good. Like you, Celestia Cat.

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you accept this gift I am offering you for the greater good?

200
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:40,654
I do.

201
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,993
Brace for takeoff!

202
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:49,997
They're getting away!

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
From you, maybe, kitty-catty.

204
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,922
Later, Loser!

205
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:09,329
Dear passengers, you may now unbuckle your seatbelt.

206
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:12,493
The cap’ts-ain and his crew hope you had a pleasant flight!

207
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,534
I’ll save you, don’t worry cockroach I’ll catch you.

208
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,797
Ooh, too bad I was this close.

209
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,229
Try that again, fleabag.

210
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,335
I'll have to pull myself together Emily.

211
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:54,356
- I may have more miraculous than Ladybug now, but not as much time.

212
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,531
- SHADYBUG: USELESS CAT
- huh?

213
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,980
Why are you always trying to steal my miraculous?

214
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Like you never try to steal mine!

215
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,954
I'm just trying to get rid of you, fleabag.

216
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:05,609
- I'd be better on my own.
- OH Yeah?!

217
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,625
- SHADYBUG: Yeah!
- CLAW-NOIR: YEAH?!

218
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:10,355
Ah, I feel a dual source of anger and despair.

219
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:15,813
The magical jewels of the Ladybug and the black cat may finally be within my reach, my love.

220
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:22,085
Nooroo, Kalki, dual metamorphosis!

221
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:32,501
Fly to these hearts that are as black as mine, Megakuma!

222
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:33,981
Voyage!

223
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:39,981
I'll be the one to seize the miraculous of the butterfly in the end, and I'll be the one that supreme spares!

224
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,708
In your dreams!

225
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,264
Huh? A Kamiko!

226
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:45,485
Cataclysm!

227
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:50,833
You didn't make me so angry, Betterfly wouldn't have detected our emotions, kitty-catty!

228
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,287
Then DON’T GET ANGRY!

229
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,802
Fine, fine. Let's calm down.

230
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,585
So then, what do we do now?

231
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:06,992
It's a good thing I still have a brain and a lead.

232
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,999
I don't feel the emotions anymore. Or my Megakuma.

233
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Dark wings fall.

234
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,952
She's freed herself.

235
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,859
She can't be far.

236
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,905
Where do you think you're going?

237
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Stay here and help me search for a clue.

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If the portal between our worlds opened here, there must be a reason.

239
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,783
You're not the boss of me, Detective Cockroach.

240
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,875
Ugh!

241
00:18:56,307 --> 00:19:00,087
- Claws in.
- Spots off.

242
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:09,344
- What's wrong?
- Your world is so different, so beautiful.

243
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:14,761
You help each other, You’re partners. 
In mine, any form of mutual aid is a crime.

244
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,533
Yet, you use your miraculous for good.

245
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,935
In my universe, ordinary people don't even know about the miraculous. It's a secret.

246
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,500
They all belong to the Supreme, who uses them only to perpetuate his own power.

247
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,671
The Supreme?

248
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:30,614
The name of the evil being who rules the world where I come from.

249
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you find out about the miraculous, if it's a secret?</font>

250
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:39,762
Sometimes. He entrusts them to the powerful of my world, all of whom have sworn loyalty to him.

251
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I too was a part of this corrupt system.</font>

252
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,890
In order to get something i wanted more than anything.

253
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:46,712
I stole too.

254
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,064
But i misused them,

255
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:51,127
and hurt the people i loved.

256
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:59,975
To redeem myself, I became better fly, because, like a moth, I have no choice but to fly in the shadows in order to give people hope.

257
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:07,813
Someone has to show them that we must revolt, that a better world is possible, provided that power is shared between all.

258
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:22,881
Claw Noir: I'm Lady Bug,

259
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:26,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my real name's Lazy Bug, because I'm lazy in every single dimension.</font>

260
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:29,950
I wish you were Claw Noir because he’s the real cool cat.

261
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:31,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish you were Claw Noir because he’s the real cool cat.</font>

262
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:37,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish you were Claw Noir because he’s the real cool cat.</font>

263
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear Diary, I can't believe I made such a blunder. I'll just die of shame this time for sure.</font>

264
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:46,167
I had a presentation to do with Adrian, my Adrian.

265
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:50,833
Ugh. How can anybody be so disgustingly sweet?

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Ugh, Cat Noir, we haven't known each other for very long, but it feels like we've been together forever.

267
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,827
Oh, Lady Bug.

268
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,996
Of course. I should've known.

269
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:08,285
I mean, like, we've been fighting villains together, right? Because there's absolutely nothing between us. He's just my partner.

270
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,970
Uh, my teammate is what I mean.

271
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,840
Ugh.

272
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,582
Now that I've seen your world, I know that my dream is not just a utopia, and you can help me reach it.

273
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:28,988
You know, our world isn't all that perfect. The one who holds your miraculous here uses it for evil.

274
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:31,966
And he just stole the miraculous I'd been guarding.

275
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:37,628
If I can't manage to defeat Monarch to save my world, how could I possibly help you save yours?

276
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:39,955
Because the values you stand for are good.

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,833
Because you are the positive incarnations of Shadybug and Claw Noir.

278
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:51,871
It may seem like they have more power than you, but they don't have your strength, because they know nothing about trust and friendship.

279
00:21:53,319 --> 00:22:01,798
I should be as distraught as you. In my world, I'm hunted relentlessly. No one believes in heroes. Everyone is afraid of the Supreme.

280
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,474
I am so lonely.

281
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,590
How do you keep from giving up?

282
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:10,118
I hold onto the one thing I have. 
Hope.

283
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:12,024
The hope for a better world.

284
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:18,000
The hope that people can evolve. For a single decision that can change an entire lifetime.

285
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:23,953
Plagg, do you think that the other holder of my miraculous could be that other world's me?

286
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,959
Well, you know. When two cheeses are made from the same milk, they can taste very different depending on how matured they are.

287
00:22:31,171 --> 00:22:34,921
So, I guess that's a possibility, yes.

288
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Tikki, do you really think that the person behind that evil Shadybug's mask could be me?

289
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:49,986
The girls were here for me. As always, they really are the best. They inspire me every day. Each one in their own way.

290
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:58,303
Alya and me, we're BFFs. It's so amazing to have a best friend like her. We're super close, you know. She's always there for me.

291
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Tikki quickly became my friend. She always looks on the bright side and restores my confidence when I feel all is lost.

292
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:17,231
The first thing that comes to my mind when describing my mom is how calm and gentle she is.

293
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:20,653
Dear Diary,

294
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:23,814
I finally know why Hawk Moth wants our magic jewels so badly.

295
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:28,677
By combining my miraculous of a ladybug with the one of the black cat, you get to make a wish.

296
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:32,015
But for that wish to come true, there would be a price to pay.

297
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:32,696
For example,

298
00:23:32,796 --> 00:23:36,713
If a robot became human, then someone would have to lose their humanity in return.

299
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,988
That's why we can never give up on our miraculous. No one must make a wish. The balance of the universe is at stake.

300
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:58,977
Lucky charm.

301
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,221
Cata--

302
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,451
Shhh.

303
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,954
Adrien Agreste?

304
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:22,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Host: Tonight, on “Never Too Late to Do Good”, we receive one of the most influential people in all of Paris.</font>

305
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:24,674
Mr. \ Mayor André Bourgeois!

306
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,570
Mayor: Thank you, thank you. The honor is mine. Good evening, everyone.

307
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,260
Ugh, makeup. Obviously, I should have guessed.

308
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:42,468
Blots off.

309
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know me?

310
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:20,921
Never mind.

311
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:25,985
Tikki, Plagg, reveal yourselves!

312
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:32,993
Why fight to get a better life when I could just switch with someone else's in another world?

313
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,387
(Gimmi), reveal yourself!

314
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,706
Host: The one and only Mr. Banana is joining us today. 
What do you think of Ladybug losing the miraculous?

315
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Stay peachy!

316
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:06,850
Tom? Tom? We fell asleep. Come on, let's go to bed.

317
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,993
Ms. Dupain-Cheng: Hold on, I forgot my phone.

318
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:23,983
Only the supreme divines reality.
Reality is the supreme.

319
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,995
Marinette? Is everything all right?

320
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, whatever. Just get off my back.

321
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,476
Are you sure you're okay, sweetheart?

322
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:39,770
Yes, I'm okay. I...

323
00:26:41,488 --> 00:26:46,998
Sorry, Mommy dear. I just dropped my sewing machine, but it's fine.

324
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,042
It's just…

325
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:50,711
slightly damaged.

326
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:56,091
Don't worry, sweetie. We'll take care of it. Broken things can always be fixed.

327
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:58,755
Good night, sweetie. I love you.

328
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:04,991
- I… love you too…, Mom.
- Wish Alya a good night for me.

329
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:07,999
Tikki, blots on.

330
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,858
Get to work, Mouser.

331
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,398
We've got to take the butterfly miraculous back. That's all we have left anyway.

332
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:40,993
Plag, dagger's out.

333
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,027
How come the supreme never told us that merging our Kwamis would grant us any wish we wanted?

334
00:27:55,888 --> 00:28:02,177
For the same reason that he never told us that using our powers would slowly destroy us. No wish will save us.

335
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:06,669
?: Not with your miraculous no, but with Ladybug and Cat Noire’s most definitely.

336
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,858
- Cataclysm!
- Lucky Charm!

337
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:21,102
I am monarch, invulnerable to your powers thanks to the miraculous of the ox. 
And I am also your best chance at having your wishes granted.

338
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:26,543
Are you willing to work with me, or would you rather keep on playing with your measly powers?

339
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:38,993
Delightful. It seems like we'll get along just fine. My plan is simple.

340
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:40,845
Tikki, spots on.

341
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,963
Plag, claws out!

342
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:47,716
We'll try to help you, betterfly.

343
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,441
- It’s Marinette, leave a message. Beep! Hehe.
- Ugh.

344
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:08,994
- They could be hiding anywhere. 
- And they will do anything to get their hands on my miraculous.

345
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,997
Even in the darkest of nights, they won’t escape my sight.

346
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,466
CLAW NOIR: Betterfly!

347
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:24,548
- If you don't want us to destroy this world...
- Then come out, come out, wherever you are! You and your new buddies!

348
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,357
I guess they’re not hiding after all.

349
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,982
Monarch must have akumatized them.

350
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,532
What a holder of the butterfly miraculous has done, another can undo.

351
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:39,437
They're not akumatized villains.

352
00:29:39,808 --> 00:29:41,751
You think Monarch could have lent them a miraculous?

353
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,255
- If that's true, we'll never defeat them.

354
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:45,562
- LADYBUG!

355
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,954
- LADYBUG!

356
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:49,438
Wait for me here.

357
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:55,271
Alya, you can't stay here. It's dangerous. Is that my mom's phone?

358
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,861
It's a long story. Your mom is fine, but check this out.

359
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,217
My plan is simple.

360
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,040
Still nothing.

361
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:11,576
Are you sure your simple plan is going to work, Your Highness?

362
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:14,714
My plan is foolproof. They will show up.

363
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:18,550
Ladybug and Cat Noir always show up in the end.

364
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,565
PHONE: My plan is simple.

365
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,338
That's the room where I first arrived.

366
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:24,558
I was there for a sleepover at my friend Marinette's.

367
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,681
Your friend Marinette. Is she safe?

368
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:28,224
Yes i made sure of that.

369
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,539
And she's confirmed with me that she's okay.

370
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:33,421
- So the two giants out there are illusions?

371
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:36,463
- Created to trap you by forcing you two to split up.

372
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:38,170
- This is only the beginning of their trap.

373
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:42,126
And even though Alya recorded it all, no matter how much I think about it, play it back to myself.

374
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:44,643
I can't find any plan against a trap like this.

375
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:48,441
M’Lady, I know you're having a hard time right now.

376
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,507
You may not believe in yourself anymore, but I believe in you more than ever.

377
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:55,987
You're the best at finding the craziest ideas, even when everything seems lost.

378
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,343
It's like your lucky charms. They never make any sense, but they work every time.

379
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:05,993
He's right. Don't lose hope. I'm sure there's a solution.

380
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:11,346
I do have an idea, but I'm afraid it might be too convoluted.

381
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,294
We're all ears, Ladybug.

382
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,907
Okay. So first of all,

383
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,538
The miraculous of the butterfly has a limited range.

384
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:22,454
Past a certain distance, he can't keep in touch with the Akumas or the people he Akumatized.

385
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:28,152
We'll need to get far enough away from Paris to be out of Monarch's reach, so Betterfly can turn Alya into Ubiquity again.

386
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:33,127
- As long as we're far away, he won't be able to remove her power.
- That's right, Cat Noir.

387
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:36,562
Next, Betterfly will lend me the butterfly miraculous.

388
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:37,998
Light wings fall.

389
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,342
This way, I'll create a second superhero with a specially crafted superpower designed to protect Cat Noir and I.

390
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:45,443
Unify.

391
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:53,996
Next, we'll hide the object into which the kamiko will have landed into the parallel world.

392
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Where it will be inaccessible to Monarch.

393
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That way, Monarch won't be able to remove your powers during the battle.

394
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And my power will protect you from the final treacherous blow Monarch plans to inflict upon you. Brilliant.

395
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now that's my lady.

396
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The strength of teamwork.

397
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:19,993
See? They can't help themselves. They always have to save the world.

398
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,998
Maybe, but there are three of them, and Ladybug is wearing the miraculous of the butterfly.

399
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,662
Your supposedly simple two-person plan no longer works, Your Majesty.

400
00:32:29,663 --> 00:32:35,663
On the contrary, now it will be even simpler to seize both their miraculous and the one of the butterfly.

401
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:43,991
As for the holder of the butterfly miraculous, whatever he has done regardless of his universe, I can undo it.

402
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:48,556
I'm sorry, Ladybug.

403
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:51,899
Thank you for your help, Alya.

404
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,970
It's you against me, giant Shadybug!

405
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Ah!

406
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,138
Oh no! It was an illusion!

407
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,323
Mhm :)

408
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,983
It's your move. Voyage!

409
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:15,935
Surprise, Ladybug.

410
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:20,996
Ladyfly, actually. Nice to meet you. I love surprises.

411
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,999
Oh, could it be that it's just an illusion?

412
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:39,900
Voyage!

413
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:43,658
See you soon, my dear good king.

414
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:51,358
Nooroo, Kalki, Mullo, Pollen, Orikko, Unify.

415
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:53,943
Multiplication!

416
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:02,992
I hope you like a positively clawful cat fight!

417
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:14,525
Are you kidding me? The only thing worse than your fighting is your clawful puns.

418
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:19,450
- CLAW NOIR: With the right c’attitude, anything is possible!

419
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:24,844
- CAT NOIR: I literally can't believe we're the holders of the same miraculous!

420
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:31,599
- CLAW NOIR: You're a sly cat.

421
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,247
Ladybug!

422
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:48,997
Cat noir? Cat NOIR??

423
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Are you lost without your little house pet?

424
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:56,022
Just because we're not together doesn't mean we're not working as a team!

425
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,712
CLAW NOIR: You're definitely not the cat in the out!

426
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:19,991
And you shouldn't count your cats before they scratch!

427
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:21,900
Fall in!

428
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:27,990
Where is this power coming from?

429
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:31,991
I can't feel any trace of akumitization.

430
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:35,432
Ah? It's a trap! Voyage!

431
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Lucky charm!

432
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,994
I wouldn't break a mirror if I were you!

433
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There's more seven years of bad luck, you know!

434
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You think it'd be any different from how it is now?

435
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Guess what? I don't have your nice little life!

436
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
In the world where I'm from, there are no awesome girlfriends to inspire me every day!

437
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,997
No amazing BFF, Let alone a mom!

438
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,996
A gentle mom or a boyfriend who doesn't think I'm a total loser!

439
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:10,638
Y-, You read my secret diary.

440
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,685
So you know we're the same, you and I.

441
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:20,597
UGH! Are you kidding? I'm the opposite of you!

442
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:25,277
All I've got in is pain and suffering from that horrible Chloe Bourgeois,

443
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:30,930
who made me suffer throughout my entire life until the Supreme entrusted me with the miraculous.

444
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,760
Now no one will hurt me anymore!

445
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,799
We have nothing in common!

446
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:41,421
You're wrong.

447
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:46,188
Reverse morphosis.

448
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:53,070
CAT NOIR: You know it's just a legend, right?

449
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:56,092
Yes I know! I know I am a legend!

450
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:57,997
CAT NOIR: I meant the one about cats not liking water.

451
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:00,776
Cats don't like water!

452
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:01,873
Well that's not true.

453
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Some cats like myself are excellent swimmers.

454
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I even have an aquatic version of my suit, don't you?

455
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I hate water and swimming pools!

456
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And conceited cats!

457
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:18,461
Conceited cats, conceited cats…

458
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:21,003
Hey now, I don't hear a pun there.

459
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,540
That's pretty unusual coming from you.

460
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:25,141
Huh?

461
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:32,189
You want a pun? Then brace yourself because until I get your miraculous,

462
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:35,725
I promise to dog your footsteps relentlessly!

463
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:40,991
Why do you have to have a miraculous that you already hold?

464
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Don't you know?

465
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:45,700
We can make a wish by merging it with the cockroaches.

466
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,796
So you need ladybugs' miraculous, not mine!

467
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,808
- It doesn't work with our own, but with yours.
- You have no idea!

468
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:57,580
Merging these two miraculouses is too powerful! There would be a great price to pay!

469
00:37:57,748 --> 00:37:58,988
- CLAW NOIR: Nothing is too powerful!

470
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,868
And there's no price too high to pay if it would bring my mother back!

471
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:04,993
- Your mother? 
- She's gone!

472
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And my father doesn't care! He's too crazy deciding dresses and costumes!

473
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But is he creating things when he's already moved on?

474
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But he has no idea how much I miss her!

475
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:18,241
I know.

476
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:21,252
If you read my diary then you know.

477
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,817
It's not all that easy.

478
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Everything often hangs by a thread.

479
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:28,448
I too was very angry. I too was hurt. I too was scared.

480
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,184
And I still struggle with all of this every day.

481
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:35,988
You don't need any magic jewel. Powers didn't change my life.

482
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I changed the way I saw myself.

483
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:42,509
I decided to love myself, to love the world around me.

484
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,993
And I decided that I could fix what was wrong in it.

485
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm sure that if you change the way you see yourself and your world,

486
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you'll be able to fix what's wrong with it too.

487
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Just like I do here, every time.

488
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,916
You can fix it all.

489
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,458
I don't want to do that corny stuff.

490
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:10,888
By doing it in a way, you'll also fix yourself.

491
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:19,947
If I make a wish, I'll have a chance to get the only thing I want.

492
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:23,877
I'll bring her back to life. I'll see my mother again.

493
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:28,827
I know. I know you, you know.

494
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:34,966
No, you don't. Don't pretend to be me, or else you wouldn't be friends with a cockroach.

495
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,584
- If you were me, your mother would also be...
- She is.

496
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:43,500
But… if you knew about the wish, why haven't you tried it?

497
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:45,815
I won't tell you that I never thought about it.

498
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,796
Of course I thought about it. But…

499
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,580
Everything comes at a price if my mother came back.

500
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:52,592
Our mother!

501
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:57,995
In order to bring our mother back, someone else would have to lose theirs.

502
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,076
And that I can't wish on anyone.

503
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:07,122
Me? I managed to go on living, trying to be happy, as she wanted me to.

504
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:08,840
I have my friends to comfort me.

505
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm okay now. I'm as well as I can be anyway.

506
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:17,319
It must be painful for someone who doesn't have any close friends, or anyone to comfort them.

507
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:19,975
Someone… like me?

508
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,993
Only you can decide not to be alone.

509
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,962
I can tell you about my friends from this world. You should meet them in yours.

510
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You'd probably get along. Take Nino, for example.

511
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Nino? I don't think he'd want to be buddies with me, considering how I treated him.

512
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
He's the most understanding person I know. Just apologize and invite him to the movies.

513
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
His favorite film, here anyway, is called Space Mutants vs. Ghost Shark.

514
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:48,241
It sounds terrible.

515
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:52,777
Let's say it's the film with the most improbable storyline I've ever seen.

516
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And yet, you're really making me want to watch it.

517
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,532
Miraculous Shadybug!

518
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,725
Thank you.

519
00:41:39,638 --> 00:41:42,991
Hey, I like your new look, Fancy Bug.

520
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It wouldn't hurt you to do the same.

521
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:47,207
- Can I? 
- You're the one who chooses your costume.

522
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:49,777
What do you want the new Claw noir to look like?

523
00:41:55,881 --> 00:42:02,463
Meow! And now I'll be called Furrypaw, or the Wonder Whiskers, or Maid of Justice, or...

524
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:04,060
Ah, I just can't pick one.

525
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:07,988
What'll be yours?

526
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:10,987
Hmm. I'll call myself...

527
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,604
Ladybug.

528
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:14,884
*Cough*, Awful! 

529
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:18,566
Hey! The best there is.

530
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:25,526
It's time. Alya Cesaire, if you'll allow me.

531
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's far from over, Ladybug. You may have escaped me once again in this universe, but it's only one among an infinity of others.

532
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:46,869
Nooroo, Orriko, Unify!

533
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:51,023
Sublimation.

534
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:59,009
The power of pretension allows me to choose a super ability. I choose access to any other existing universe.

535
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,648
I'm feeling a disruption, like another connection between universes is opening up at the same time as mine!

536
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:06,656
Monarch.

537
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But how?

538
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:12,468
He has the Miraculous or the Rooster now, and can use it to create whichever superpower he wants.

539
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:15,131
Will he be able to travel across universes?

540
00:43:15,132 --> 00:43:17,988
And attack every Ladybug in Cat Noir in existence?

541
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'll handle it.

542
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:30,988
Miraculous Scarabella.

543
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:35,329
Pound it!

544
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Your earrings are mine!

545
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:42,232
It's not gonna happen in this world, Monarch.

546
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,326
Not here either!

547
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:11,449
No matter how far you get, you'll never, ever win!

548
00:44:23,816 --> 00:44:24,816
Reverse Morphosis.

549
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:34,980
Ladybug, I will destroy you. You and every other Ladybug in all the parallel universes!

550
00:44:40,156 --> 00:44:47,999
Monarch won't be going to any other world other than this one anytime soon, and here, Cat Noir, me and our friends, we'll make sure to put an end to his reign.

551
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Even though we haven't figured out how to yet.

552
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I am certain you will succeed. I thank you again for your help.

553
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Thank you, Betterfly. You helped us get back something precious that we had lost.

554
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:01,900
Hope.

555
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:04,905
And you too have gained new teammates.

556
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:12,760
Yeah, by the way, we're gonna need a teammate, like the Supreme Movers. You know, a blend of Supreme and Removers. Get it. Get the joke.

557
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Don't get smart, Fleabag. When the Supreme figures out that we're no longer on his side, we won't be laughing.

558
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
He won't be laughing either, believe me, because we'll be stronger now that we're together.

559
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,966
Remember that you have friends here.

560
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:33,998
And there are more friends are waiting for you on the other side.

561
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:41,916
Wait! In our world, we always do a little something when things end well.

562
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,948
Pound it!

563
00:46:05,122 --> 00:46:06,972
huh? You okay girl?

564
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:10,960
Yeah, I was just thinking, life can really go in which way.

565
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:15,075
If we hadn't found ourselves sitting next to each other at the start of the school year,

566
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:20,976
I don't know if I would have become confident enough to become Ladybug. And who knows what would have happened today.

567
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,994
You made all the right choices, Marinette.

568
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,649
Do you remember what you told me on the first day of school?

569
00:46:28,712 --> 00:46:33,998
All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing.

570
00:46:34,474 --> 00:46:37,971
I only made the right choice because you're a good person, Alya.

571
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:40,937
Oh, Marinette.

572
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:47,990
What if we made the right choice now and got some delicious breakfast?

573
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:52,996
Excellent choice. And then we're gonna take a little nap.

574
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:57,981
Hello, girls. How'd you sleep?

575
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:01,000
Very well, Mom.

576
00:47:02,564 --> 00:47:05,564
Hey, Mrs. Dupain Cheng. Isn't that your phone over there?

577
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,851
Thanks, Alya. I couldn't find it anywhere.
